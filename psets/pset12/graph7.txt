# Graph file format example:
# To represent a graph: 
# The number of vertex in the graph comes at the first line.
# The number of edges comes In the following line, 
# Then list a pair of vertices connected each other in each line.
# The order of a pair of vertices should not be a matter.
# Blank lines and the lines which begins with # or ; are ignored. 
#
# The lines that begins with . will be read into graph data structure
# and displayed on request.
