1 If I speak in the tongues of men or of angels, 
but do not have love, I am only a resounding gong or a clanging cymbal. 
2 If I have the gift of prophecy and can fathom all mysteries and all knowledge, 
and if I have a faith that can move mountains, but do not have love, 
I am nothing. 
3 If I give all I possess to the poor and give over my body to hardship that I may boast,
but do not have love, I gain nothing.

4 Love is patient, love is kind. 
It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. 
5 It does not dishonor others, it is not self-seeking, 
it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs. 
6 Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth. 
7 It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres.

8 Love never fails. But where there are prophecies, 
they will cease; where there are tongues, they will be stilled; 
where there is knowledge, it will pass away. 
9 For we know in part and we prophesy in part, 
10 but when completeness comes, what is in part disappears. 
11 When I was a child, I talked like a child, I thought like a child, 
I reasoned like a child. When I became a man, I put the ways of childhood behind me. 
12 For now we see only a reflection as in a mirror; then we shall see face to face. 
Now I know in part; then I shall know fully, even as I am fully known.
13 And now these three remain: faith, hope and love. But the greatest of these is love.
